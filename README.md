# Simon Game: A Colorful Memory Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simon Game, a project created by Purvansh Rathore. This game is a classic memory and reflex challenge that will put your color-recognition skills to the test. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** To begin playing, press any key on your keyboard. This action initiates the game and displays the first color that blinks, marking the start of Level 1.

2. **Remember and Repeat:** The blinking color sequence represents the pattern you need to follow. Your task is to click on the colors in the exact order they appeared. For example, if the color that blinks is orange, click on the orange color on the game interface.

3. **Progressing Through Levels:** As you successfully replicate the sequence, the game advances to the next level. With each new level, an additional color is added to the sequence. Your challenge is to remember the entire sequence and click the colors in the correct order.

4. **Testing Memory and Reflexes:** The Simon Game progressively becomes more challenging as the sequences grow longer. This challenges your memory recall and quick reflexes. How far can you go without making a mistake?
